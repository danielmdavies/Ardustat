#Ardustat

###The software is currently under development. I apologize for any inconveniences.

###Dependencies:
- Arduino (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- FTDI Drivers / Arduino Uno Drivers, depending on which version of arduino you are using (seeÂ Getting Started guide for arduino at http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).
- We're now a node shop.  
   - Get node [here](http://nodejs.org/)

###Notes:
The ardustat has the capability to do both potentiostatic and galvanostatic electrochemical testing with systems containing 2 to 3 electrodes. It uses a standard arduino board with a custom built shield and can be run from a single USB port. 

####Important Usage Info:

* Working Electrode: Red Wire
* Counter Electrode: Black/Grey Wire
* Reference Electrode: Other Wire

If you are using a two electrode setup be sure to tie the reference electrode to the counter electrode.

####Important Specs
* Current Range: 0.1 microA to 10mA
* Votlage Range: 5V with 0.5mV resolution. (Negative voltages and currents are fine)


###Installation and Setup:
1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the 'pithy' directory of this repository
3. Start pithy by typing `forever start index.js 4001`
4. Start the raw shower by typing `forever start raw_shower.js 4004`
5. Connect at least one ardustat
6. Make sure the correct firmware is uploaded to the arduino. (firmware_030915)
7. In functions_3_play.js change the port list to suit the ports that you are using. ('/devttyACM0, '/dev/tty.usbmodemfd121' etc.) (I am sorry about this, I will get around to writing an automatic port finder soon)
8. `cd` into main directory and run `npm start` to begin the program
9. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to use the Ardustat
10. On first use, make sure to calibrate the Ardustat

####Questions, Comments, Bugs Etc.
As the software is currently under development there are a few bugs and pieces of functionality missing. I apologise for this. I am currenlty working through a long to-do list to try and rectify this. Please feel free to email me at danielmdavies@gmail.com with any changes you would like to see. Please feel free to contribute!

Best,

Dan D
